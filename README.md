This is a mod for Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master!\
It shows your highest difficulty crowns at the bottom left of each song on the song select, and shows ura too.\
It has support for Mono (1.2.2) and IL2CPP (1.3.0+) versions of the game.

This is heavily based on goat's TaikoTweaks mod, with a few added features (Showing oni and ura at the same time, and showing the crown on the currently selected song)
